# phising_url_detection
This project is a web application designed to detect phishing URLs using machine learning. It leverages Flask for the web framework and a pre-trained Gradient Boosting Classifier model for the prediction. Users can input a URL, and the application will analyze its features to determine the probability of it being a phishing site.
